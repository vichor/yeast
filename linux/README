YEAST
=====

Yeast stands for Yet Another Security Thing, a home security, surveillance,
supervision and automation system.

Yeast is a system built on top a Raspberry Pi 2 board with sensors and
additional devices connected as needed.

It is a linux based system built using Yocto. This directory contains all the 
needed yocto layers and recipes to build the system plus a script to setup a
working directory with all the yocto stuff needed to perform the build.

The supplied script will download the yocto/poky pacakges and the official
raspberry pi layer into the supplied directory. It will then copy there the
yeast product specific layers.

Dependencies
------------
For yocto to work you will need to install below packages (asuming apt 
repository tool).

$ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo \
 build-essential chrpath libsdl1.2-dev xterm

Installing yocto and layers
---------------------------
You may just used the supplied yprepare.sh to download all the needed stuff
and setup a directory to work with. You may get help with the -h option.

Get yocto and layers with -d <directory> option:

$ ./yprepare.sh -d myyoctoworkingdirectory


Building the system
-------------------
When getting the toolchain, the script yprepare.sh will already have setup 
also the build directory ready to geneate Yeast root file system including all 
the needed software.

To build the system there's a script which launches bitbake. Just call it with
-d <directory>, being this directory the one you have just setup before.

$ ./ybuild.sh -d myyoctoworkingdirectory
