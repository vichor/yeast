YEAST
=====

Yeast stands for Yet Another Security Thing, a home security, surveillance,
supervision and automation system.

Yeast is a system built on top a Raspberry Pi 2 board with sensors and
additional devices connected as needed.

It is a linux based system built using Yocto. This directory contains all the 
needed yocto layers and recipes to build the system plus a script to setup a
working directory with all the yocto stuff needed to perform the build.

The supplied script will download the yocto/poky pacakges and the official
raspberry pi layer into the supplied directory. It will then copy there the
yeast product specific layers.

Dependencies
------------
For yocto to work you will need to install below packages (asuming apt 
repository tool).

$ sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo \
 build-essential chrpath libsdl1.2-dev xterm

Installing yocto and layers
---------------------------
You may just used the supplied gettoolchain.sh to download all the needed stuff
and setup a directory to work with. You may get help with the -h option.

Get yocto and layers with -d <directory> option:

$ ./gettoolchain.sh -d myworkingdirectory

If you want to download yocto yourself you may use below commands:

$ git clone -b fido git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
$ cd poky
$ git clone -b fido git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
$ git clone -b fido git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
$ <TODO: get yeast layers>


Building the system
-------------------
Inside your defined yocto directory, you will find an empty directory named
build (only if you used gettoolchain.sh script). This directory is used as 
working directory for the build. 

You will need first to setup the environment for yocto scripts to work on your
build directory. To do so, launch below command.

$ source oe-init-build-env build

<TODO: finish build instructions>
